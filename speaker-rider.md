# Speaker Rider 
Chinasa T. Okolo, Ph.D. \
www.chinasatokolo.com

Thank you for your interest in booking me for a speaking engagement! Over the years, I have enjoyed speaking at dozens of domestic and international workshops, panels, conferences, and webinars. Please read this document carefully before proceeding with contact. I will respond to all inquiries within three (3) business days unless I am on vacation.

Note: If requested to travel, I request at least a one-month notice for domestic events and a two-month notice for international events. 

## Speaking Fee
Given the value of my expertise and time dedicated to my research, it is important that I receive compensation for my participation in events. I do not charge for events hosted by student groups or nonprofit organizations unless there is an existing budget for speakers. My speaking fee is also waived for smaller-scale or virtual events unless the event is ticketed (paid registration) or there is also an existing budget for speakers.

### Honorarium
Due to the complexity of speaking arrangements, I do not have a standard honorarium. Please contact me to discuss a fee commensurate with your request.

## Travel Logistics
I am based at the Brookings Institution, a  501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Given Brookings’ limited ability to cover travel for scholars, I require that my travel (airfare, ground transportation, accommodation, and meals) be covered by organizations or individuals requesting my in-person participation at events.

### Flight and Ground Transportation
I am based in Washington, D.C., and typically travel out of Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) or Ronald Reagan Airport (DCA). My preferred airline is United Airlines when flying domestically and internationally. For travel to international locations not directly served by United, I prefer to be booked with [Star Alliance partners](https://www.staralliance.com/en/members) (e.g., Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines). All flight bookings should be in premium economy class or higher (no basic economy).

I travel with passports of the United States and Nigeria. I also request that visa fees be covered for countries where I need a visa.

If your event is based in/near Downtown D.C., I will gladly arrange my transportation. I request roundtrip car service/rideshare arrangements for further events within the DMV area to ensure my comfort and safety.

For events outside of D.C., I request that local transportation to the event venue be provided during the event unless it is within walking distance from my accommodation.

### Accommodation
For domestic and international events outside of Washington, D.C., and for which air travel is required, I request accommodation for the evening before and throughout the event or until the day after my speaking engagement.
Booked lodging must be non-smoking and equipped with reliable Wi-Fi. All room-related expenses, including taxes and incidentals, must be covered.

### Reimbursement
I prefer that travel and accommodation be booked on my behalf. In cases where it may be necessary to make my own travel arrangements, I request that all reimbursements be completed promptly and no later than Net 30.

## Event Logistics
The sections below detail my preferences for in-person events. For hybrid or remote events, I prefer to give live presentations. I am also open to pre-recorded presentations for events in significantly different time zones.

### Ticketing
As a speaker, I request a ticket to access the full event to enhance my participation and engagement with other speakers, panelists, and attendees.

### Marketing
Please refer to this [document](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/MediaKit/blob/main/biography-details.md) for my approved biography and name pronunciation. My headshots are available [here](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/MediaKit/tree/main/images/headshots). I request that my middle initial “T.” be used in all formal correspondence and marketing materials (“Chinasa T. Okolo” not “Chinasa Okolo”). My title ("Dr." or "Ph.D.") should be added to my name when appropriate.

I am also happy to promote my involvement in your event on social media. If necessary, please provide me with any social media templates or blurbs/hashtags to use. 

### Event Setup
For formal presentations, I prefer to use my MacBook Pro and USB-C/HDMI adapter to connect to projectors. For accessibility purposes, I request access to a microphone. Lapel (lavalier) or on-podium microphones are suggested, but I can also work with handheld microphones. Listed below is the ideal setup I prefer:
* Microphone
* Power source for MacBook Pro
* Projector with HDMI input and cable
* Confidence monitor

### Moderation
For panels or other event setups that require moderation, I request that questions be provided at least two business days beforehand. Moderation should be provided in accordance with the event code of conduct, and efforts should be taken to prevent harassment for both in-person and remote events.

### Recording/Photography
I appreciate having access to photos and audiovisual recordings taken throughout my participation in your event. If required, please share a release form to obtain my consent beforehand. All speaking and presentation materials are the intellectual property of Chinasa T. Okolo unless I am contracted to create content specifically for your event.

### Accessibility
For the comfort and safety of myself and all participants, I request standard accessibility measures for all in-person and remote events. In-person events should be accessible in accordance with standards set by the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-221) and in compliance with local facility access requirements. Online events should be accessible in accordance with [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) guidelines. To assist with live-captioning for in-person/remote events, I am happy to share the script of my presentation.

### Health Precautions
Given the perpetual existence of COVID-19, I prefer to attend events that follow scientific guidance in handling health and environmental safety precautions.

### Security
If needed, security should be provided for in-person events. 

### Data Privacy
I do not consent to having my data sold or shared. Every effort should be in place to ensure the privacy of my data and those of other speakers and attendees. My personal information, especially information used to book travel and accommodation, should be collected and stored per [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu) guidelines.
