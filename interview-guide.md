# Interview Guidance
Chinasa T. Okolo, Ph.D. \
www.chinasatokolo.com

Thank you for your interest in interviewing me! Over the years, I have enjoyed speaking to various media outlets for traditional interviews, podcasts, articles, and more. Please read this document carefully before proceeding with contact.

## Interview Requests
The sections below detail my preferences for handling media interview requests.

### Initial Contact
All initial contact should detail the following:
* Who will conduct the interview
* What platform the interview is for (Bloomberg, CNN, WIRED, etc.)
* How the interview will be conducted (remotely, in-person, email, etc.)
* When the interview will be conducted (date and time)
* Where and how the interview will be published (podcast episode, article, etc.)

### Interview Questions
I request questions be provided at least two business days before the interview. For on-air interviews, I would also appreciate having access to an interview script or run-of-show document. 

### Recording
I generally consent to have interviews recorded to aid with transcription. For media interviews that involve on-air or pre-recorded videography, please provide me with guidance on preferred lighting and background settings. If required, please share a release form to obtain my consent for recording before the interview.

### Editing
For recorded interviews, I request access to the transcript to review any discrepancies. Please inform me if the interview will be translated.

### Publication
I request that all published content resulting from the interview be shared with me. If you intend to re-use or distribute content from my interview, especially in another format or for another platform, my consent should be requested beforehand.

### Marketing
Please refer to this [document](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/MediaKit/blob/main/biography-details.md) for my approved biography and name pronunciation. My headshots are available [here](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/MediaKit/tree/main/images/headshots). I request that my middle initial “T.” be used in all formal correspondence and publication formats (“Chinasa T. Okolo” not “Chinasa Okolo”). My title ("Dr." or "Ph.D.") should be added to my name when appropriate. 

I am also happy to promote my interview on social media. If necessary, please provide me with any social media templates or blurbs/hashtags to use. 

### Data Privacy
I do not consent to having my data sold or shared. Any data used for the interview should be collected and stored per [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu) guidelines.
